# New Hire Test
> ## Description
You are to create a new class member (Function) that simply prints the existing class member "hello" concatenated with another string that you create.

Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/)


>If you don't already have typescript installed, install it globally:
- Windows Users:
  - Open a command prompt in administrator mode
  - Run `npm i typescript -g`
- OSX/Linux Users
  - Open terminal
  - Run `npm i typescript -g --unsafe-perm=true`


>Simply clone this repo, then run `npm install` in the directory.

>Run `tsc` in the directory to transpile the Typescript to Javascript

>Run `node build/index.js` to run your application

We recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for an editor. Using editors like Notepad++ will not offer the features necessary for developing Typescript applications.
